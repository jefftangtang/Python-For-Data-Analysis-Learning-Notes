# Python For Data Analysis Learning Notes

This is the study notes I took during the program of [Google Advanced Data Analytics](https://www.coursera.org/programs/los-angeles-county-library-smggm/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics?source=search).

This note focuses on using packages, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `seaborn`, for data analsis.
